#+TITLE: Coding Katas

A /coding kata/ is a practice session focused on a specific objective:
a chapter from a book, a tutorial, a reference project illustrating a
particular point of software development...

This repository is a collection of my personal katas. It is organized
as follows:

- The [[file:code/][code]] directory contains the katas organized in chronological
  order, by codename (=CK= = Coding Kata).

- The [[file:wiki/][wiki]] directory brings order to the katas by referencing them
  from specific points of view.
