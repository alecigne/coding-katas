#+TITLE: Coding Katas

A /coding kata/ is a practice session focused on a specific
objective. This repository is a collection of my personal katas.

It is organized as follows:

- The [[file:code/][code]] directory contains the katas organized in chronological
  order, by codename.

  A kata can be a chapter from a book, a tutorial, a reference project
  illustrating a particular point of software development...

  I try as much as possible not to modify a project long after I've
  started it. Sometimes, an entire book will focus on a single
  project. In that case, I create a new project starting from the
  previous one. It also makes documentation easier.

- The [[file:wiki/][wiki]] directory contains documentation that references these
  software projects under specific themes.
