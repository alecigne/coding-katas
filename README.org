#+TITLE: Coding Katas

A /coding kata/ is a practice session focused on a specific objective.

It can be a chapter from a book, an online tutorial, an exercice from
LeetCode/HackerRank/etc., or simply a personal reference project
illustrating a particular point of software development.

This repository is a collection of personal katas. It is organized as
follows:

- The [[file:code/][code]] directory contains software projects in no particular order
  other than alphabetical.

- The [[file:wiki/][wiki]] directory brings structure by linking the katas to their
  respective project. Every kata has a codename starting with =CK=
  (for Coding Kata).

If you think katas are a good idea and would like to make your own
repo, check the [[file:wiki/about.org][about page]] for inspiration.
