#+TITLE: Coding Katas

A /coding kata/ is a practice session focused on a specific objective:
a chapter from a book, a tutorial, a reference project illustrating a
particular point of software development...

This repository is a collection of personal katas. It is organized as
follows:

- The [[file:code/][code]] directory contains the projects in no particular order
  other than alphabetical.

- The [[file:wiki/][wiki]] directory brings structure by linking these projects to
  specific katas. Every kata has a codename starting with =CK= (for
  Coding Kata).

If you think katas are a good idea and would like to make your own
repo, check my [[file:wiki/rules.org][personal rules]] for inspiration.
