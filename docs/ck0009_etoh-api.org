#+TITLE: [CK0009] =etoh-api=

[[file:../code/ck0009_etoh-api/][Project]] created on [2018-10-22 Mon].

This project capitalizes on [[file:ck0007_spring-boot-minimal.org][=spring-boot-minimal=]] to build a very
simple backend for the [[file:ck0008_angular-extended-tour-of-heroes.org][Extended Tour of Heroes (ETOH) Angular
frontend]].

It uses an in-memory H2 database initialized automatically by Spring
Boot, through a =data.sql= file in =src/main/resources/=.

* TODOs

- [ ] Fix bug: can't rename a hero
